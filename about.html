            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <div class="callout-about">The Games of Consequence Lab is design-led and inspired by research on our largest humanitarian issues.</div>
            <br>
            <p>While we love translating academic data into systems that can change attitudes and hearts,
                we are foremost committed to creating games and interfaces that are genuinely beautiful to look at and
                fun to play.</p>
            <p>We build playful representations of complex real-world ecosystems, ranging from the granular dynamics
                between creatures,
                people, and their environments to the broader global contexts of plastics waste industries and popular
                cultures.</p>
            <p>Our games are at once highly polished design artifacts and critical research devices which model
                concepts, translate knowledge, and scutinise systems.</p>
            <p>We collaborate with experts across creative, technological, and scientific fields to build systems around
                issues that often feel unwinnable.
                We don't just teach players the rules; we invite them to question, make, and even break them.</p>
            <p>Games of Consequence is based at RMIT University as part of the Centre of Digital Ecosystems (CODE).</p>
