## A PC Build Simulator and Cosy Game 

My Dream PC is a sim-game created as a tribute to the vibrant PC building community, and especially to the talented and generous women who openly share their intense creative process, technical expertise, and finished builds across social media. Female PC Builder communities especially emerged during COVID lockdowns when they expanded the practice to include full room builds to compliment the PC designs.

Looping lo-fi beats accompany players as they peruse a library of candy-coloured, kawaii-inspired assets for their PC creations. Designed as a pleasant invitation to anyone wanting to build by relying on simple game controls, basic progression through object customisation and placement mechanics, and no requirement for prior technical knowledge.

The game seeks to bridge gaps between traditional masculine hobbies and feminine design by providing an accessible play space free from financial and gendered barriers in the hopes of encouraging a more diverse community of practice in the cultural ecosystems of PC building.
