The Material Map tool is a factory simulator which gives stakeholders the ability to map out their role within the plastics supply chains of Aotearoa New Zealand. This interactive tool is designed for plastics recyclers and manufacturers to input their waste and product dataâ€”eventually building the *first* significantly large map of the ecosystem.

This constellated mechanical map is reminiscent of Real-time strategy (RTS) games; transforming business and manufacturing information into dynamic spinning cogs and materials of changing colour and movement. The simulation of material flows are controlled through simple point-and-click manoeuvres and built upon an intuitive language of shapes, symbols, and colours.

Companies contextualise the ecosystem and how they fit within it by simulating specific types of plastic inputs, outputs such as waste and products, and production rates. With a range of customisations for timescales and filters highlighting pre and post-consumer fields and waste layers, this tool highlights missing links and where waste is accumulating in order to better mitigate against plastics pollution.

By revealing gaps in relationships and the true amount of waste leakage occuring, companies are inspired to become more sustainable and get closer to circularity in the NZ plastics ecosystem.
