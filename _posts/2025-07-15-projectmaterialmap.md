A Playable Factory Simulator for Plastics Circularity

This material mapping tool is an interactive factory simulator that enables stakeholders to visualise and map their role within Aotearoa New Zealand’s plastic supply chains. Designed for recyclers, manufacturers, and other sector players, this tool allows users to input real product and production data—contributing to the development of the first country-level simulation of New Zealand’s plastic product and waste ecosystem.

Resembling the interface of a real-time strategy (RTS) game, this mechanical, constellated map transforms industrial processes into dynamic, moving parts—spinning cogs, shifting materials, and responsive colour-coded flows. Material movements are controlled through intuitive point-and-click actions, grounded in a visual syntax of shapes, symbols, and colours.

Users can simulate specific types of plastic inputs, product outputs, and production rates, while also adjusting timescales and toggling filters to visualise pre- and post-consumer activity. These features reveal critical gaps in the system—exposing hidden waste streams, missing connections, and points of leakage—helping organisations identify where improvements can lead to more circular and sustainable outcomes.

Beyond mapping current operations, the Material Map also encourages experimentation. Stakeholders can test speculative strategies by swapping out inputs and outputs, adjusting volumes, or reconfiguring partnerships—giving rise to new possibilities for a truly circular plastics economy in Aotearoa.
