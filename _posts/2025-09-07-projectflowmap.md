This is a dynamic network map displaying the scale and complexity of the NZ Plastics ecosystem. All of the ‘players’ in this system are clustered by sector and are connected by four main flow types: material, data, service, and finance.

Rather than viewing static images of graphs and numbers the Plastics NZ Network Map populates and displays information through visually pleasing animation and user interfaces. Various flow types between stakeholders can be filtered to explore the current state of system dynamics. Users can challenge and experiment with alternative flows and see potential impacts on the broader system by adding new sector opportunities that are connected by functioning flows to strengthen or weaken individuals, sectors, and systems.

Through inputting data in dynamic and playful ways users gradually learn the system while teasing out the explicit and implicit relationships between businesses. The filtering system highlights where gaps exist and who the most influential and essential stakeholders are, determined by visual and gravitational rules. Lines connecting stakeholders through flow types vary in style depending on how regular interactions take place.

This tool simplifies and makes intuitive complex stakeholder ecosystems which are typically too dense and ever-evolving to capture through regular business applications.

Created in collaboration with stakeholders of the “ReShaping the Plastics NZ Ecosystem project” 2023-2028 funded by the NZ MBIE Endeavour Fund (Research Programmes) - Led by Prof Johan Verbeek (University of Aukland), Prof Deb Polson (RMIT), Prof Simon Bickerton (UoA), and Assoc/Prof Julia Fehrer (UoA)
