This is a dynamic network map displaying the scale and complexity of the NZ Plastics ecosystem. All of the 'players' in this system are clustered by sector and are connected by 4 main flow types: material, data, service, and finance. 

Rather than viewing static images of graphs and numbers the Network Flow Map tool populates and displays information through visually pleasing animation and user interfaces. Various flow types between stakeholders can be customised and filtered to explore the current state of system dynamics. Users can also challenge and experiment with alternative flows and see the potential inpacts on the braoder system. You can add new sector opportunities that are connected by functioning flows to strengthen or weaken individual, sector, and system.

Through inputting data in dynamic and playful ways users gradually learn the system while teasing out the explicit and implicit relationships between businesses. The filtering system highlights where gaps exist and who the most influential and essential stakeholders are determined by visual and gravitational rules. Additionally, lines connecting stakeholders through flow types will vary in style depending on how regular or irregular certain interactions take place.

The Network Flow Map is a tool which simplifies and makes intuitive complex stakeholder ecosystems which are typically too dense and ever-evolving to capture through regular business applications.


Created in collaboration with stakeholders of the "ReShaping the Plastics NZ Ecosystem project" 2023-2028 funded by the NZ MBIE Endeavour Fund (Research Programmes) - Led by Prof Johan Verbeek (University of Aukland), Prof Deb Polson (RMIT), Prof Simon Bickerton (UoA), and Assoc/Prof Julia Fehrer (UoA)
