In Deep Water invites players to explore an artfully sculpted digital marine biorama. 

Natural ecosystems in Aotearoa New Zealand can be observed through quirky game controls and are accompanied by research on the impacts of plastic waste on the habitats of species such as birds, kelp, and whales. While investigating shallow coastlines and deep ocean waters, players witness how a thriving environment can eventually turn desolate as a consequence of human action and *inaction*. 

Players encounter a retro-futuristic control panel—possibly created by a rogue scientist—full of buttons, dials, and levers. These controls help to navigate stunning NZ waterways and discover abandoned sensors installed by previously negligent companies and concerned research groups. If enough vital data is collected from these beacons it's possible that the environment which is increasingly troubled by microplastics may be saved from future (and present) devastation.

## "Using fun controllers and accidentally learning how bad plastics are."

The discoverable data is sourced from experienced, real-world microbiologists who devote specific attention to local Aotearoa waterways and the life that resides in and around them.

A prototype of In Deep Water showcased in the 2025 ACMI Audience Lab, and is the first in a series seeking to capture the previous and current vitality of Oceania water biomes— *before* they are irrevocably changed.
