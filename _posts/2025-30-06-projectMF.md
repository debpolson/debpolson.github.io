MetaForest documents and returns the magic of nature to the mundanity of everyday spaces, bridging the gap between urbanisation and organic spectacle through a mixed reality installation.

Members of the public are surrounded and embedded into projections of dynamic local Victorian forest scapes and their inhabitants within liminal human-made spaces such as shopping malls, carparks, and abandoned buildings.

Using a combination of industrial sensors, visual projection mapping, and gaming technologies, the experience simulates nearby natural settings which audiences can absorb and interact with. Through play, they are reminded of what once was and what exists *just* outside of their typical routine.

Debuting at ACMI Audience Lab, people engaged playfully and collaboratively with the installation, with some working together to achieve effects in the projection, children exploring the space to its fullest, and some pausing to express awe before continuing on in their day.
