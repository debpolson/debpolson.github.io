Market Entropy is a board game prototype originally created in the context of the ReShaping the Plastics NZ Ecosystem project. This multiplayer game is applicable to any stakeholders striving to change their business attitudes from zero-sum to market-shaping.

The game is played out on a slanted grid to display the interconnectedness of policies and demands in a generalised, abstracted marketplace. Resources are symbolised by colour-coded, stackable blocks which can be built into products. The game plays out over nine phases including turns of purchasing, running factories, voting, and building, using a set of tokens and playing cards signifying actions, bids, and player-roles in the market.

Zero-sum is a concept existing in both game and economic fields to describe how, in competition, one party will always lose as a result of another party's gain. This is an antiquated view of how markets function which does not take into account constantly changing variables. The market-shaping perspectives in Market Entropy acknowledge that players have the agency to influence the market ecosystems themselves.

The physicality of a table-top board game makes visible and tactile the often secretive practices of market players and treats resources, such as energy and funds, as exhaustible rather than exploitatively viewing them as infinite.

The game premise exists to symbolise the shifting affects of demands, policies, and available resources and how players can actively participate in shaping them. Gameplay captures the entropy of market systems and communicates that while players can prepare for flux they cannot predict *everything*.

Playtesting this prototype has provided the space to gain feedback and collaborative creatively with our business partners, mapping out dynamics and finding communal win-states and bridging our understandings through ditching the zero-sum game thinking that permeates both tabletops and economies. 

Should the win-states truly be based on capital? Or could it be sustainability? The power to influence the market? During play these decisions can be made through safe, virtual interventions, to inform how we work together in the real-world.
